# PieceItTogether

Gets a random chess position from chess.com's database and obfuscates the pieces.

The premise of the game is to guess the exact placement of every piece within 6 tries. It's kind of like Wordle.

^ NOTE: It's currently not working because my AWS server shut down due to activity... I'll probably fix this in the next ten years.
